- 👋 Hi, I’m @troycodesok.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github, please be patient while I put in pull requests that break everything I've worked on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that make life easier to manage for the people that have it the hardest.
- 💌 You can find me on the bird app @troycodesok
